DEVSECOPS
==========

DevOps is a process of building, testing and deploying the application on the same day,
When Developer writes something through this process. We can achieve collaboration, coordination, commuination between teams, faster releases and less defects. 

SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle 
Waterfall vs Agile vs DevOps vs DevSecOps vs AiOps

SDLC
========

Linux --> Linus Torvalds
=================
UNIX --> Hardware and Software(Unix OS) together,
CPU, RAM, Hard Disk, OS(Software)
Laptop --> IBM BIOS


Windows
=================
Open Source,
Costly,
Not secure must install anti virus,
Slow,
Graphics, 
Frequent restarts,
Tough to update/upgrade,

Linux 
================
Secure,
High speed --> mostly text,
No need of restarts,
Install or update packages is easy,
Low resources,

================

>> Client server :: A client-server model is how computers interact in a network. The server is like a central hub that provides services or data.

>> Firewall :: A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
            It acts like a gatekeeper, protecting a network or device from unauthorized access and potential threats.

>> Authentication method :: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to resources.

   Authentucation method ::  Connections were secured with authentication, such as API keys for service-to-service communication or SSH keys for server access.

>> Key generation :: Keys (e.g., SSH, API, or TLS certificates) were generated to authenticate and encrypt connections between servers.

  "Key generation is the process of creating cryptographic keys to secure communication,
                      authenticate systems, or encrypt data. For example, we generate public and private keys for secure access or API keys for authentication.
                      In my project, we used key generation to secure our automated deployment pipeline for a cloud-based application.
                      We generated SSH keys to securely access cloud servers and API keys for our deployment tools to interact with services like AWS.

>> Launch Server :: A launch server is a virtual server you start in the cloud to run an application or service.
                    For example, in my project, we launched servers on AWS to host our cloud-based application.
 
A launched server (e.g., an EC2 instance) becomes a connecting server when it communicates with other systems, like a database or external API, to run your application.

>> Connecting server :: A connecting server refers to a server in a network or cloud environment that establishes communication with other servers,
                       services, or clients to perform tasks, share data, or deliver services.
